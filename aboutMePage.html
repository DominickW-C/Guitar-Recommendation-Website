        <p id = 'para'>Hello! my name is Dominick and I am currently a Freshman at Plymouth State University going for Computer Science. The purpose of this website is to be a project over break to work on learning web development. I'm hoping to do a project like this often, with a  few ideas being a fake guitar shop and a discord bot. any new things will be included on this page!</p>
