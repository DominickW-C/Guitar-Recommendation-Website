            For a Advanced guitar I feel like it is hard to recommend one guitar as if you want something this high end, you want something that serves your wants and needs.
            For this reason, I recommend going through the Fender Mod Shop so you can get a American quality Fender with the exact specifications you want. 
            You can really make this your guitar, as you can choose body, color, wood types, pickguards, pickups, and other smaller features. 
            When you are buying a guitar that is around $2,000, you want it to have the exact specifications for you personally, and that is why I think for an advance recommendation the best bet would be the mod shop.
