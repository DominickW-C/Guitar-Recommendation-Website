        <p id = 'pageContent'>For a beginner guitar I highly recommend that you go with something by the Squire line. 
            This is Fender's budget line of guitars, and if you go for a higher quality guitar from this line you won't be disappointed.
            Personally, I would recommend the Contemporary series, and more specifically the Jaguar From this line.
            It is a very comfortable body to hold, with a equally comfortable neck.
            The hardtail design means that you don't have to deal with a tremolo system which can be a headach for new players to get used to.
            The two humbucker pickups sound very great and will give you a ton of tone options starting out.
