        <h1 id = 'title'>Intermediate Recommendation</h1>
        <p id = 'pageContent'>For a Intermediate Guitar, I highly recommend going with something from the PRS SE line of guitars.
            These are their budget line of guitars that are not made in America, but every guitar is inspected in the States as soon as they get there to ensure the quality.
            To narrow the selection down even more, I would go with the PRS SE Silver Sky, as it is one of the most comfortable guitars that I have played in that price point.
            Not only this but the range of tones that you can get form it is very nice, as the single coils can handle high-gain very well.
            There are also options for a rosewood or maple neck, which means you get to choose your preferred wood. 
            At a price point around $800 and it goes on sale sometimes for a little under $700, this is one that you can't pass up as a intermediate player.
