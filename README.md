This is a website I made freshman year of college (between first and second semester)
in order to work on my web-dev skills. I focused on using HTML and CSS, and
I tried to implement JavaScript but failed to. Working with JS how now become 
my next task for in between freshman and sophmore year. This readme will also
be to help me learn how to make changes to a git repo.
